Description: In this project, I've undertaken the task of refactoring the Horiseon website homepage code. The primary objective behind this refactoring endeavor is to enhance the efficiency, readability, and accessibility of the existing codebase. Additionally, the goal is to achieve improved search engine optimization without altering the visual styling of the page; the modifications are strictly focused on optimizing the underlying code for better performance.

Tasks completed:  streamlined redundant classes, opting for consolidation. Semantic HTML elements replaced generic ones, enhancing the document's structure. Alt text was incorporated for images, promoting accessibility. Explanatory comments now guide through the HTML document. The CSS underwent a reorganization, adhering to a more logical structure. To enhance clarity, classes and elements were separated and then alphabetically ordered within their respective groups. I introduced comments to clearly mark each separation. Lastly, a descriptive title was appended for better context.
