I fixed up the code for the Horiseon website to make it work better. The main goal was to make the code easier to understand, more efficient, and accessible. I also wanted to boost how well the site shows up on search engines without changing how it looks.

Here's what I did:

I got rid of unnecessary code and made things simpler.
I used better HTML elements to organize the page better.
I added descriptions to images so that people using screen readers can understand them.
I put comments in the code to explain what each part does.
I organized the CSS code to make it more logical and easy to follow. I separated different parts and put them in alphabetical order. I also added comments to show where each part starts and ends.
I gave the page a clear and descriptive title for better context.
These changes make the website work smoother behind the scenes and help people understand and use it better.
